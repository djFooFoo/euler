# This solution is fast enough, but you can go further than this

#The palindrome can be written as:
#abccba
#Which then simpifies to:
#100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100c + 10b + a
#100001a + 10010b + 1100c
#11(9091a + 910b + 100c)

# This way you got to check 11 time less options (as the palindrome has to be divisable by 11)
